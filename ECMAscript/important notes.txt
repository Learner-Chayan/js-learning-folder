ES6 and Hoisting
................
The JavaScript engine, by default, moves declarations to the top.
 This feature is termed as hoisting. This feature applies to variables and functions. 
 Hoisting allows JavaScript to use a component before it has been declared.
 However, the concept of hoisting does not apply to scripts that are run in the Strict Mode.


Dynamic Typing 
.................
JavaScript is an un-typed language.
 This means that a JavaScript variable can hold a value of any data type. 
 Unlike many other languages, you don't have to tell JavaScript during variable
  declaration what type of value the variable will hold. The value type of a 
 variable can change during the execution of a program and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.
 This feature is termed as dynamic typing
