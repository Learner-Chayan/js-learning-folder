ECMASCRIPT (ES) - European Computer Manufacturers Association Script

*ECMAScript, along with Document Object Model, works similarly to the current implementations of JScript and JavaScript.
JavaScript, on the other hand, can be viewed as a "dialect(উপভাষা)" of ECMAScript .

* Developers can use the shiny new features that come with ES6, but may be concerned with cross-browser compatibility for
 their web apps. At the time of the writing of this article,
 Edge and Internet Explorer do not fully support features from the ES6 specification.

 *   In 1997, due to JavaScript’s rapid growth, it became clear that the language would need to be properly maintained and managed.
    Therefore, Netscape handed the job of creating a language specification to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA),
    a body founded with the goal of standardizing computing.The ECMA specifications were labeled ECMA-262 and ECMAScript languages
    included JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript.
